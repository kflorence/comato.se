title: The Visitation
---

    In the lonesome, somber skies
        In ghostly, pale white
        (Fluttering, hovering)
    With darkness in its eyes
        Bound by some earthly plight
        Pondered I: "What causeth a haunted soul
        To emerge this wintry night
    For eternal slumber to demise?
        Why dost thou quiver and moan
        In sheets of ghostly, pale white?"
    (Figureless, but draped in lies)


    And then, a sudden chill
        The visitant drew in near
        (Lingering, loitering)
    And drew in closer still
        As if to whisper something in my ear
        Implored I: "What dost thou want foul demon,
        Shadowy phantom of the air?
    You have my attention, tell me thy will!
        What of this queer visitation?
        Of your burden I must hear!"
    (And with a lurid shriek the sky did fill!)


    Thereupon (in the wake of its cries)
        On gaunt limbs the phantom did stride
        (Leering, piercing)
    I stood still, entranced by its fiery eyes
        Which bore the memories trapped inside
        Without utterance, the spirit my soul conjured
        And upon my conscious this tale conferred:
    "In days of yore for thee I did ride
    Seduced into battle by thy sweet lies
        Whilst thou pillaged thy land and stole thy wife!
        And although in miserable life to thee I did abide
    (In death no more) Hear you me: everything dies!"


    Then, amidst this ghoulish nightmare
        Imparted in silent roar
        (Haunting, troubling)
    My eyes opened wide and peeled bare
        Devoured this devilish lore
        And in this silent evening of fiendish dreaming
        I awoke to find myself alone once more
    "Leave me, phantom of the night!" I shouted at the air
        But there was no response, only apprehension
        Which left me trembling on the floor
    (And what sanity I possessed, I surely left it there!)


    And in the stillness of the night
        I nervously hastened back to the quiet sea
        (Scampering, fleeting)
    O, how I wished this damp forest the sun to light
        And in this wretched darkness no more to be!
        For the torment contained in that visitation stare
        (A most ferocious tempest did bore in thee)
    Of thy life; thy grim spirit of ghostly, pale white!
        Thine eyes I shall not close
        'Til thy restless soul of torment shall be free
    (For thy sleep is sure to be a woeful plight!)
