title: Seeds

    Traffic flows through the streets
    mimicking the tiny, volatile cells of our bodies
    submissive to the whims of the changing lights

    Futures squirm from the safety of their wombs
    the culmination of a lusty union of destiny and fate
    a susceptable fetus ripened amidst monetary greed

    Numbers wake to the dull pulse of bedside alarms
    tired eyelids strain open to spark their stoic minds
    like zombies they rise, to carry out their meaningless lives

    The decrepit lay solemnly as a dejected testiment of vigor lost
    young aspirations left withered in a porcelain pot by the window
    their forsaken seeds flourish not far from the tree
