title: Archipelago

    There's an island in my eye
    surrounded by a sea
    where many have drowned
    while they gazed into me

    Jutting out like a canker
    in the mist where it lies
    in the cold, tormented water
    which licks at the sky

    Where the rain briskly waltzes
    in its shoes made of sea
    where ships had once sailed
    towards this island of me

    Ships tossed in storms
    on that dark, foamy brine
    where titanic waves stirred
    in this ocean of mine

    Where tempests proudly flaunt
    their unremitting might
    as their thunder and lightning
    prematurely awakened the night

    And the seas quickly swell
    the tides impulsively rise
    until they breach the levy
    of these saturated eyes

    Flowing in succession
    down my damp salty face
    where a river has born
    as the droplets embraced

    And in the eye of the storm
    where the gales have ceased
    a small weathered boat
    drifts silently east

    An exhausted young maiden
    is scanning my shore
    With her tired hands clasped
    to what is left of an oar

    By chance our eyes meet
    a congregation of seas
    filled with uncharted islands
    an archipelago of we.
